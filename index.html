    <p class="column">Hello and welcome!<br>Here is abit of history on triangles:</p>
    <img src="images/images.jpeg" alt="sailing triangle:)" class="float">
    <p class="column">In Ancient Babylon, they used triangles in their buildings and roofs.
      Their geometry also extended to the calculation of the areas of rectangles and trapezoids,
      as well as the volumes of simple shapes such as bricks and cylinders.<br>
      The Chinese used to use bamboo rods for counting, but they soon discovered that triangles
      could be used for the same purpose and many others as well, such as measuring whether an angle was obtuse or acute or right.<br>
      In Egypt they used triangles as designs for sacred buildings like pyramids(which even show up today on the US dollar).<br>
      In Greece, a mathematician named <strong><em>Thales</em></strong> made up a method for finding a ships height at sea by using the triangular sails length and height
      (in a similar way the Egyptians used math to measure pyramids).

    <h2>With that said here are the main <em>types of triangles</em> we have:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="textsize"><img src="images/equilateral.png" alt="an image of an equilateral triangle"> Equilateral triangles.</li>
      <li class="textsize"><img src="images/isosceles.png" alt="an image of an isosceles triangle"> Isosceles triangles.</li>
